🧾 Mini SSH brute-force detection challenge using log parsing tools (grep, awk, wc)

🔎 Summary

* I did this mini log-analysis challenge on my Kali VM to see if I could spot traces of an SSH brute-force attempt. 

* Since my /var/log/auth.log didn’t have real traffic, I made up a small demo file (demo_auth.log), with a few realistic login entries — both failed and successful ones.
    
   -> Here's how I did that 👉 [View command output screenshot]([View screenshot](https://github.com/MallikaKundeti/My-Cyber-projects/blob/508f5b780eb18cec2fd34bfaff0a8de53812ec9a/Screenshot%20(699).png)


* From there, I used command-line tools like grep, awk etc to count failed logins, find which IPs were behind them, and see which user accounts they were trying to break into. 

 
🧩 Findings 

Nov 12 10:01:02 kali sshd: Failed password for invalid user admin from 203.0.113.10 port 54321 ssh2  
Nov 12 10:01:07 kali sshd: Failed password for root from 198.51.100.23 port 51111 ssh2  
Nov 12 10:02:15 kali sshd: Accepted password for mallika from 203.0.113.10 port 54321 ssh2  
Nov 12 10:05:00 kali sshd: Failed password for root from 203.0.113.10 port 60001 ssh2  


✨ Quick stats:

* Failed logins → 3

* Successful logins → 1

* Repeat offender → 203.0.113.10 (2 attempts)

* Accounts hit → root (2), admin (1)

* The repeat attempts from one IP — especially targeting root — look exactly like early brute-force noise that sysadmins keep an eye out for.


🧠 Assessment

Risk level: Medium ⚠️ (for demo)

Even though this was a handcrafted dataset, it mimics real-world SSH brute-force behavior — multiple failed attempts from the same IP and privileged-account targeting. These patterns would usually trigger automated defenses like fail2ban or IP-based blocks.


💡 Recommendations

* Disable direct root SSH login (PermitRootLogin no in /etc/ssh/sshd_config).

* Use SSH keys instead of passwords for remote access.

* Install fail2ban or similar tools to ban repeat offenders automatically.

* Keep monitoring /var/log/auth.log for recurring failed attempts.
